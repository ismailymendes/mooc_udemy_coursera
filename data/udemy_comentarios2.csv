What a wonderful intro about tuning into and working with electromagnetic fields :) Thank you for sharing!

125029758;3175814;5;2022-09-30T21:13:49-07:00;Jacqueline;123 This course is the best on Udemy.  This breakdance instructor breakdance with such style and bravado like the Puerto Rican New York breakdancers.  They are the authentic breakdancers and I should know because I'm a New Yorker and was around in the 80's when breakdancing was created and in the 70's when rap and grafitti were created.  New York was the creator of these art forms
